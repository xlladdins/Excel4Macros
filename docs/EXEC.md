# EXEC

Starts a separate program. Use EXEC to start other programs with which
you want to communicate. Use EXEC with Microsoft Excel's other DDE
functions (INITIATE, EXECUTE, and SEND.KEYS) to create a channel to
another program and to send keystrokes and commands to the program.
(SEND.KEYS is available only in Microsoft Excel for Windows.)

Syntax 1 is for Microsoft Excel for Windows. Syntax 2 is for Microsoft
Excel for the Macintosh.

**Syntax 1**

For Microsoft Excel for Windows

**EXEC**(program\_text, window\_num)

**Syntax 2**

For Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh

**EXEC**(program\_text, , background, preferred\_size\_only)

**Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh
requires system software version 7.0 or later for the last two arguments
of this function.

Program\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name, as a text string, of
any executable file or, in Microsoft Excel for Windows, any data file
that is associated with an executable file.

  - > Use paths when the file or program to be started is not in the
    > current directory or folder.

  - > In Microsoft Excel for Windows, program\_text can include any
    > arguments and switches that are accepted by the program to be
    > started. Also, if program\_text is the name of a file associated
    > with a specific installed program, EXEC starts the program and
    > loads the specified file.


**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, you must
use an extra comma after the program\_text argument. This skips the
window\_num argument that does not apply to the Macintosh.

Window\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 1 to 3 that
specifies how the window containing the program should appear.
Window\_num is only available for use with Microsoft Excel for Windows.
The window\_num argument is allowed on the Macintosh, but it is ignored.

|                 |                    |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Window\_num** | **Window appears** |
| 1               | Normal size        |
| 2 or omitted    | Minimized size     |
| 3               | Maximized size     |

Background&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that determines
whether the program specified by program\_text is opened as the active
program or in the background, leaving Microsoft Excel as the active
program. If background is TRUE, the program is started in the
background; if FALSE or omitted, the program is started in the
foreground. Background is only available for use with Microsoft Excel
for the Macintosh and system software version 7.0 or later.

Preferred\_size\_only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that
determines the amount of memory allocated to the program. If
preferred\_size\_only is TRUE, the program is opened with its preferred
memory allocation; if FALSE or omitted, it opens with the available
memory if greater than its minimum requirement. Preferred\_size\_only is
only available for use with Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh and system
software version 7.0 or later. For information about changing the
preferred memory size, see your Macintosh documentation.

**Remarks**

In Microsoft Excel for Windows and in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh
with system software version 7.0, if the EXEC function is successful, it
returns the task ID number of the started program. The task ID number is
a unique number that identifies a program. Use the task ID number in
other macro functions, such as APP.ACTIVATE, to refer to the program. In
Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh with system software version 6.0, if
EXEC is successful, it returns TRUE. If EXEC is unsuccessful, it returns
the \#VALUE\! error value.

**Examples**

In Microsoft Excel for Windows, the following macro formula starts the
program SEARCH.EXE. Use paths when the file or program to be started is
not in the current directory:

EXEC("C:\\WINDOWS\\SEARCH.EXE")

The following macro formula starts Microsoft Word for Windows and loads
the document SALES.DOC:

EXEC("C:\\WINWORD\\WINWORD.EXE C:\\MYFILES\\SALES.DOC")

In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, the following macro formula starts
Microsoft Word:

EXEC("HARD DISK:APPS:WORD")
