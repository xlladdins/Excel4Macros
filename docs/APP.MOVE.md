# APP.MOVE

Equivalent to clicking the Move command on the Control menu for the
application window. Moves the Microsoft Excel window. In Microsoft Excel
for Windows, if the application window is already maximized APP.MOVE
returns the \#VALUE\! error value and interrupts the macro.

**Syntax**

**APP.MOVE**(x\_num, y\_num)

**APP.MOVE**?(x\_num, y\_num)

**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This function is only for Microsoft Excel for
Windows. You can use this function in macros created with Microsoft
Excel for the Macintosh, but it will return the \#N/A error value.

X\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the horizontal position of the
Microsoft Excel window measured in points from the left edge of your
screen to the left side of the Microsoft Excel window.

Y\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the vertical position of the
Microsoft Excel window measured in points from the top edge of your
screen to the top of the Microsoft Excel window.

**Remarks**

  - > APP.MOVE?, the dialog-box form of the function, doesn't display a
    > dialog box. Instead, it is equivalent to pressing ALT + SPACEBAR,
    > M or to dragging the title bar with the mouse. With APP.MOVE?, you
    > can move the window with the keyboard or mouse.

  - > If you specify x\_num and/or y\_num in the dialog-box form of the
    > function, the window is moved according to the specified
    > coordinates, and you are left in move mode.
