# LINK.COMBO

Links an edit box and a list box control into a linked combination box
group. The resulting linked controls track each other's selection and
contents. Linked edit and list box combinations are similar to an
editable drop-down list box, except that the list box is permanently
visible and dropped down.

**Syntax**

**LINK.COMBO**(**link\_logical**)

Link\_logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that specifies
whether the controls are linked or unlinked. If TRUE, the controls will
become linked. If FALSE, the controls will be unlinked.

**Remarks**

To use this function, first select the list box and edit box to be
linked or unlinked. You can do this with SELECT("list box 1,Edit box
2").

**Examples**

LINK.COMBO(FALSE) will unlink a list box and an edit box.
