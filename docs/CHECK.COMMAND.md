# CHECK.COMMAND

Adds or removes a check mark to or from a command name on a menu. A
check mark beside a command indicates that the command has been chosen.

**Syntax**

**CHECK.COMMAND**(**bar\_num**, **menu**, **command**, **check**,
position)

Bar\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the menu bar containing the command.
Bar\_num can be the ID number of a built-in or custom menu bar.

Menu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the menu containing the command. Menu can
be either the name of a menu as text or the number of a menu. Menus are
numbered starting with 1 from the left of the screen.

Command&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the command you want to check or the
submenu containing the command you want to check. Command can be the
name of the command as text or the number of the command; the first
command on a menu is in position 1.

Check&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value corresponding to the
check mark. If check is TRUE, Microsoft Excel adds a check mark to the
command; if FALSE, Microsoft Excel removes the check mark.

position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of a command on a submenu
that you want to check.

**Remarks**

  - > The check mark doesn't affect execution of the command. Microsoft
    > Excel automatically adds and deletes check marks to some commands,
    > such as the name of the active workbook in the Window menu. If you
    > have assigned a check mark to a built-in command that Microsoft
    > Excel automatically changes in response to the user's actions, the
    > check mark will be added or removed as appropriate, and any check
    > marks you have added or deleted with CHECK.COMMAND will be
    > ignored.

  - > If you use CHECK.COMMAND with a command on a Microsoft Excel
    > version 4.0 menu bar, the corresponding command on the Microsoft
    > Excel version 5.0 or later menu bar will not be effected.


**Example**

The following macro formula adds a check mark to the Sales command on
the Weekly menu on a custom menu bar created by the ADD.BAR function in
a cell named Reports:

CHECK.COMMAND(Reports, "Weekly", "Sales", TRUE)
