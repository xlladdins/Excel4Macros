<h1 id="open.mail">OPEN.MAIL macro</h1>
<p>Equivalent to clicking the Open Mail command on the Mail submenu on File menu.</p>
<p><strong>Note   </strong>This function is available for only Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh and Microsoft Mail version 2.0 or later.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>OPEN.MAIL</strong>(subject, comments)</p>
<p><strong>OPEN.MAIL</strong>?(subject, comments)</p>
<p>Subject    is the subject of the message containing a file that Microsoft Excel can open.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>For each message whose subject matches the subject argument and contains a file that Microsoft Excel can open, the file is opened in Microsoft Excel; if the message has no unread enclosures, it is deleted from the list of pending mail.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If subject is omitted, then for all messages containing files that Microsoft Excel can open, the files are opened; each message that has no unread enclosures is deleted from the list of pending mail.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comments    is a logical value that specifies whether comments associated with the Microsoft Excel files are displayed. If comments is TRUE, Microsoft Excel displays the comments; if FALSE, comments are not displayed. If omitted, the current setting is not changed.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If you use consistent subjects in your Microsoft Mail messages, you can easily create a macro that always opens mail messages with certain files attached. For example, an OPEN.MAIL formula with subject specified as "Weekly Report" would open the Microsoft Excel file attached to the message containing that subject each week.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In OPEN.MAIL?, the dialog-box form of the function, the currently running macro pauses while the Microsoft Mail documents window is displayed. The macro resumes after you close the Microsoft Mail documents window.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
