# WINDOW.MINIMIZE

Shrinks a window to an icon. In Microsoft Excel for Windows, using
WINDOW.MINIMIZE is equivalent to clicking the minimize button on a
workbook window. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, the minimize
feature is not supported.

**Syntax**

**WINDOW.MINIMIZE**(window\_text)

Window\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies which window to minimize.

  - > Window\_text is text enclosed in quotation marks or a reference to
    > a cell containing text.

  - > If window\_text is omitted, Microsoft Excel minimizes the active
    > window.


**Remarks**

If a window is already minimized, WINDOW.MINIMIZE has no effect.
