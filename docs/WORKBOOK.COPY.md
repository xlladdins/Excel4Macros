**Syntax**

**WORKBOOK.COPY**(**name\_array**, dest\_book, position\_num)

**WORKBOOK.COPY**?(name\_array, dest\_book, position\_num)

Name\_array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of a sheet, or an array
of names of sheets, that you want to copy in the currently active
workbook.

Dest\_book&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the workbook to which
you want to copy name\_array. If dest\_book is the current workbook,
name\_array is copied within the workbook. If dest\_book is omitted, the
copy of name\_array becomes a separate workbook.

Position\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number that specifies the
target position for the sheet within the new workbook. The first
position is 1.

  - > If position\_num is specified, Microsoft Excel inserts the copy of
    > the sheet at the specified position in the workbook.

  - > If position\_num is omitted, Microsoft Excel places the sheet at
    > the last position in the workbook.

  - > If dest\_book is omitted, position\_num is ignored.


**Remarks**

  - > If the structure of the workbook is protected, you cannot copy
    > sheets within the workbook or to another workbook.

  - > You cannot copy a hidden sheet.
