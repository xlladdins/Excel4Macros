# WINDOWS

Returns the names of the specified open Microsoft Excel windows,
including hidden windows. Use WINDOWS to get a list of active windows
for use by other macro functions that return information about or
manipulate windows, such as GET.WINDOW and ACTIVATE. The names are
returned as a horizontal array of text values, in order of their
appearance on your screen. The first name is the active window, the next
name is the window directly under the active window, and so on.

**Syntax**

**WINDOWS**(type\_num, match\_text)

Type\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number that specifies which types
of workbooks are returned by WINDOWS, according to the following table.

|               |                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type\_num** | **Returns window names from these types of documents** |
| 1 or omitted  | All windows except those belonging to add-in workbooks |
| 2             | Add-in workbooks only                                  |
| 3             | All types of workbooks                                 |

Match\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the windows whose names you
want returned and can include wildcard characters. If match\_text is
omitted, WINDOWS returns the names of all open windows.

**Tips**

  - > You can change the output of a horizontal array to vertical with
    > the TRANSPOSE function.

  - > You can use WINDOWS with the INDEX function to select individual
    > window names from the array for use in other functions that take
    > window names as arguments.

  - > You can use the COLUMNS functions to count the number of entries
    > in the array, which is the number of windows.


**Examples**

If the active window, named BOOK1, is on top of a window named MACROS:2,
which is on top of a window named MACROS:1, then:

WINDOWS() equals {"BOOK1", "MACROS:2", "MACROS:1"}
