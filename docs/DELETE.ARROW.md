# DELETE.ARROW

Deletes the selected arrow, either drawn as an arrow with the arrow tool
or as a line that is later formatted as an arrow. In Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 or later, arrows are named lines.

**Syntax**

**DELETE.ARROW**( )

If the selection is not an arrow or a line formatted as an arrow, or if
the active window is not a chart, DELETE.ARROW interrupts the macro.

**Tip**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the SELECT function (chart syntax), with
the number of the arrow (or line) you want to delete in order to select
the arrow before using the DELETE.ARROW function. For example, SELECT
("Line 1"). You can also use the CLEAR function to delete the arrow.
