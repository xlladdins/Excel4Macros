The arguments correspond to the text boxes on the Summary tab of the
Properties dialog box. If any arguments are omitted, that text box is
left empty.

necessarily a file name. Long names can be entered, up to 255
characters.

matter of the workbook.

Author&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is initially the name specified in the

appears from the Options command from the Tools menu. If this is
omitted, the registered user of the copy of Microsoft Excel will be
used.

Keywords&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are keywords that can be later used in
searching for the contents in the file.

Comments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a comment that can be entered to
help a user learn more about the contents or subject matter of the
