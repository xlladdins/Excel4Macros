# QUERY.GET.DATA

Builds a new query using the supplied information. The application
Microsoft Query nor any dialog boxes are displayed.

**Syntax**

**QUERY.GET.DATA**(**connection\_string**, **query\_text**,
keep\_query\_def, field\_names, row\_numbers, destination)

**QUERY.GET.DATA**?(connection\_string, query\_text, keep\_query\_def,
field\_names, row\_numbers, destination)

Connection\_string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplies information, such as
the data source name, user ID, and passwords, necessary to making a SQL
connection to an external data source. For example: "DSN=Myserver;
Server=server1; UID=dbayer; PWD=buyer1; Database=nwind".

&nbsp;

  - > You must define the data source name (DSN) used in
    > connection\_string before you try to connect to it.

  - > You can enter connection\_string as an array or a string. If
    > connection\_string exceeds 250 characters, you must enter it as an
    > array.

  - > If QUERY.GET.DATA is unable to access the data source using
    > connection\_string, it returns the \#N/A error value.


Query\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the SQL language query to be
executed on the data source.

Keep\_query\_def&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that, if TRUE
or omitted, preserves the query definition. If FALSE, the query
definition is lost and the data from the query no longer constitutes a
data range.

Field\_names&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that, if TRUE or
omitted, places field names from Microsoft Query into the first row of
the data range. If FALSE, the field names are discarded.

Row\_numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that, if TRUE,
places row numbers from Microsoft Query into the first column in the
data range. If FALSE or omitted, the row numbers are discarded.

Destination&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the location as a cell reference
where you want the data placed. If destination is in a current data
range then that data range is changed to reflect the new SQL statement.
The default destination is the currently selected cell or range.

**Remarks**

  - > If the information provided is not sufficient to create the query
    > then the error value \#REF\! is returned.

  - > If Microsoft Query is unavailable or can not be found, \#N/A is
    > returned.

  - > If connection string is longer than 255 characters, the string
    > will be truncated at the last semi-colon.
