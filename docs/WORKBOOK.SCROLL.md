Scrolls through the sheets in a workbook.

**Syntax**

**WORKBOOK.SCROLL**(**num\_sheets**, firstlast\_logical)

Num\_sheets. is a number specifying how many sheets to scroll and the
direction of scrolling. Positive numbers scroll forward by that many
sheets. Negative numbers scroll backward by that many sheets. Zero (0)
does not scroll.

Firstlast\_logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies whether to scroll to
the first or last sheet in the workbook. If TRUE, scrolls to the last
sheet in the workbook. If FALSE, scrolls to the first sheet in the
workbook. If this argument is specified, then num\_sheets is ignored.
