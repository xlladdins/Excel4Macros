# DELETE.COMMAND

Deletes a command from a custom or built-in menu. Use DELETE.COMMAND to
remove commands you don't want the user to have access to or to remove
custom commands that you have added.

**Syntax**

**DELETE.COMMAND**(**bar\_num, menu, command**, subcommand)

Bar\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the menu bar from which you want to
delete the command. Bar\_num can be the ID number of a built-in or
custom menu bar. See ADD.COMMAND for a list of ID numbers for built-in
menu bars and shortcut menus.

Menu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the menu from which you want to delete
the command. Menu can be the name of a menu as text or the number of a
menu. Menus are numbered starting with 1 from the left of the screen.

Command&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the command you want to delete, or the
name of a submenu. Command can be the name of the command as text or the
number of the command; the first command on a menu is in position 1.

Subcommand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the command you want to delete from
a submenu. If you use subcommand, you must use command as the name of
the submenu.

**Remarks**

  - > If the specified command does not exist, DELETE.COMMAND returns
    > the \#VALUE\! error value and interrupts the macro.

  - > After a command is deleted, the command number for all commands
    > below that command is decreased by one.

  - > When you delete a built-in command, DELETE.COMMAND returns a
    > unique ID number for that command. You can use this ID number with
    > ADD.COMMAND to restore the built-in command to the original menu.


**Example**

The following macro formula removes the Compile Reports command from the
Reports menu on a custom menu bar created by the ADD.BAR function in a
cell named Financials.
