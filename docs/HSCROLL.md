# HSCROLL

Horizontally scrolls through the active sheet by percentage or by column
number.

**Syntax**

**HSCROLL**(**position**, col\_logical)

Position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the column you want to scroll
to. Position can be an integer representing the column number or a
fraction or percentage representing the horizontal position of the
column in the sheet. If position is 0, HSCROLL scrolls through your
sheet to its leftmost edge. If position is 1, HSCROLL scrolls through
your sheet to its rightmost edge. For charts that do not size with the
window, use a fraction or percentage.

Col\_logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying how
the function scrolls.

  - > If col\_logical is TRUE, HSCROLL scrolls through the sheet to
    > column position.

  - > If col\_logical is FALSE or omitted, then HSCROLL scrolls through
    > the sheet to the horizontal position represented by the fraction
    > position.


**Remarks**

  - > To scroll to a specific column n, either use HSCROLL(n, TRUE) or
    > use HSCROLL(n/256). To scroll to column 38, for example, use
    > HSCROLL(38, TRUE) or HSCROLL(38/256).

  - > If you are recording a macro and move the scroll box several times
    > in a row, the recorder only records the final location of the
    > scroll box, omitting any intermediate steps. Remember that
    > scrolling does not change the active cell or the selection.
