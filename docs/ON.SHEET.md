# ON.SHEET

Starts a macro whenever the specified sheet is activated from another
sheet.

**Syntax**

**ON.SHEET**(sheet\_text, macro\_text, activate\_logical)

Sheet\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the sheet that
triggers a macro when it is activated, in the form "\[Book1\]Sheet1". If
omitted, then when any sheet in any book is activated, macro\_text will
run.

Macro\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the macro to run when
the specified sheet is activated. If omitted, then the triggering of a
macro on the specified sheet is cancelled.

Activate\_logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that
specifies if the macro is run when the sheet is activated or
deactivated. If TRUE or omitted, the macro is run when the sheet is
activated. If FALSE, the macro is run when the sheet is deactivated.

**Examples**

ON.SHEET("\[STORE.XLS\]Sheet1","WeeklyCalc") will run the macro
"WeeklyCalc" when "\[STORE.XLS\]Sheet1" is activated.

ON.SHEET(,"WeeklyCalc") runs "WeeklyCalc" when any sheet in the book is
activated.

ON.SHEET("\[STORE.XLS\]Sheet1") cancels the triggering of "WeeklyCalc"
when Sheet1 in the book STORE.XLS is activated.

ON.SHEET("\[STORE.XLS\]","WeeklyCalc") runs "WeeklyCalc" when any sheet
in the book STORE.XLS is activated
