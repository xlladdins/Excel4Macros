<h1 id="table">TABLE macro</h1>
<p>Equivalent to clicking the Table command on the Data menu. Creates a table based on the input values and formulas you define on a worksheet. Use data tables to perform a "what-if" analysis by changing certain constant values in your workbook to see how values in other cells are affected.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>TABLE</strong>(row_ref, column_ref)</p>
<p><strong>TABLE</strong>?(row_ref, column_ref)</p>
<p>Row_ref    specifies the one cell to use as the row input for your table.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Row_ref should be either an external reference to a single cell on the active worksheet, such as !$A$1 or !Price, or an R1C1-style reference to a single cell in the form of text, such as "R1C1", "R[-1]C[-1]", or "Price".</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If row_ref is an R1C1-style reference, it is assumed to be relative to the active cell in the selection.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Column_ref    specifies the one cell to use as the column input for your table. Column_ref is subject to the same restrictions as row_ref.</p>
