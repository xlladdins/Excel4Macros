# FOR.CELL

Starts a FOR.CELL-NEXT loop. This function is similar to FOR, except
that the instructions between FOR.CELL and NEXT are repeated over a
range of cells, one cell at a time, and there is no loop counter.

**Syntax**

**FOR.CELL**(**ref\_name**, area\_ref, skip\_blanks)

Ref\_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name in the form of text that
Microsoft Excel gives to the one cell in the range that is currently
being operated on; ref\_name refers to a new cell during each loop.

Area\_ref&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the range of cells on which you want
the FOR.CELL-NEXT loop to operate and can be a multiple selection. If
area\_ref is omitted, it is assumed to be the current selection.

Skip\_blanks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying
whether Microsoft Excel skips blank cells as it operates on the cells in
area\_ref.

|                  |                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Skip\_blanks** | **Result**                         |
| TRUE             | Skips blank cells in area\_ref     |
| FALSE or omitted | Operates on all cells in area\_ref |

**Remarks**

FOR.CELL operates on each cell in a row from left to right one area at a
time before moving to the next row in the selection.

**Example**

The following macro starts a FOR.CELL-NEXT loop and uses the name
CurrentCell to refer to the cell in the range that is currently being
operated on:

FOR.CELL("CurrentCell", SELECTION(), TRUE)
