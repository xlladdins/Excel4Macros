<h1 id="freadln">FREADLN macro</h1>
<p>Reads characters from a file, starting at the current position in the file and continuing to the end of the line, placing the characters in the cell containing FREADLN. (For more information about a file's position, see FPOS.) If FREADLN is successful, it returns the text it read, up to but not including the carriage-return and linefeed characters at the end of the line (in Microsoft Excel for Windows) or the carriage-return character at the end of the line (in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh). If the current file position is the end of the file or if FREADLN can't read the file, it returns the #N/A error value.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>FREADLN</strong>(<strong>file_num</strong>)</p>
<p>File_num    is the unique ID number of the file you want to read data from. File_num is returned by a previously executed FOPEN function. If file_num is not valid, FREADLN returns the #VALUE! error value.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The following function reads the next line from the open file identified as FileNumber:</p>
<p>FREADLN(FileNumber)</p>
