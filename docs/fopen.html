<h1 id="fopen">FOPEN macro</h1>
<p>Opens a file with the type of permission specified. Unlike OPEN, FOPEN does not load the file into memory and display it; instead, FOPEN establishes a channel with the file so that you can exchange information with it. If the file is opened successfully, FOPEN returns a file ID number. If it can't open the file, FOPEN returns the #N/A error value. Use the file ID number with other file functions (such as FREAD, FWRITE, and FSIZE) when you want to get information from or send information to the file.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOPEN</strong>(<strong>file_text</strong>, access_num)</p>
<p>File_text    is the name of the file you want to open.</p>
<p>Access_num    is a number from 1 to 3 specifying what type of permission to allow to the file:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Access_num</strong></td>
<td><strong>Type of permission</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1 or omitted</td>
<td>Can read and write to the file (read/write permission)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2</td>
<td>Can read the file, but can't write to the file (read-only permission)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>3</td>
<td>Creates a new file with read/write permission</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If the file doesn't exist and access_num is 3, FOPEN creates a new file.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If the file does exist and access_num is 3, FOPEN replaces the contents of the file with any information you supply using the FWRITE or FWRITELN functions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If the file doesn't exist and access_num is 1 or 2, FOPEN returns the #N/A error value.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<p>Use FCLOSE to close a file after you finish using it.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The following function opens a file identified as FileName using read-only permission:</p>
<p>FOPEN(FileName, 2)</p>
