# WHILE

Carries out the statements between the WHILE function and the next NEXT
function until logical\_test is FALSE. Use WHILE-NEXT loops to carry out
a series of macro formulas while a certain condition remains TRUE.

**Syntax**

**WHILE**(**logical\_test**)

Logical\_test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a value or formula that
evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. If logical\_test is FALSE the first time the
WHILE function is reached, the macro skips the loop and resumes running
at the statement after the next NEXT function. If there is no NEXT
function in the same column, WHILE displays an error message and
interrupts the macro.

**Remarks**

If you know exactly how many times you'll need to carry out the
statements within a loop, in most cases you should use a FOR-NEXT loop.
Also, avoid creating an infinite loop by making sure logical\_test does
not always evaluate to TRUE.

**Example**

The following statement starts a loop that executes while the value in
the current cell is less than 5:

\=WHILE(TYPE(ACTIVE.CELL()\<5))

The following statement starts a loop that executes until the position
in the open file identified as FileNumber reaches the end of the file:

\=WHILE(FPOS(FileNumber)\<=FSIZE(FileNumber))
