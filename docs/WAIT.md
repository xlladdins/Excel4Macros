# WAIT

Pauses the macro until the time specified by the serial number.

**Syntax**

**WAIT**(**serial\_number**)

Serial\_number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the date-time code used by
Microsoft Excel for date and time calculations. You can give
serial\_number as text, such as "4:30 PM", or as a formula, such as
NOW()+"00:00:04", instead of as a number. The text or formula is
automatically converted to a serial number. For more information about
serial\_number, see NOW.

**Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAIT suspends all Microsoft Excel
activity and may prevent you from performing other operations on your
computer. Background processes, such as printing and recalculation, are
continued.

**Example**

Use WAIT with NOW to pause a macro for a length of time or until the
time specified by the serial number. For example, the following macro
formula waits 3 seconds from the time the functions are evaluated:

WAIT(NOW()+"00:00:03")

**Related Function**

[ON.TIME](ON.TIME.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runs a macro at a specific time
