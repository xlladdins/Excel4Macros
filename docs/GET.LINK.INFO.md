| 2             | Date of the latest edition as a serial number. Returns \#N/A if link\_text is not a publisher or a subscriber. |

Type\_of\_link&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 1 to 6 that
specifies what type of link you want to get information about.

| **Type\_of\_link** | **Link document type**       |
| 1                  | Not applicable               |
| 2                  | DDE link (Microsoft Windows) |
| 3                  | Not applicable               |
| 4                  | Not applicable               |
| 5                  | Publisher (Macintosh)        |
| 6                  | Subscriber (Macintosh)       |

Reference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the cell range in R1C1 format
of the publisher or subscriber that you want information about.
Reference is required if you have more than one publisher or subscriber
of a single edition name on the active workbook. Use reference to
specify the location of the subscriber you want to return information
about. If the subscriber is a picture, or if the publisher is an
embedded chart, reference is the number of the object as displayed in
the Name box.

**Remarks**

  - > If Microsoft Excel cannot find link\_text, or if type\_of\_link
    > does not match the link specified by link\_text, GET.LINK.INFO
    > returns the \#VALUE\! error value.

  - > If you have more than one subscriber to the edition link\_text or
    > if the same area is published more than once, you must specify
    > reference.
