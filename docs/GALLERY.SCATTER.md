# GALLERY.SCATTER

Changes the format of the active chart to an xy (scatter) chart.

**Syntax**

**GALLERY.SCATTER**(**type\_num**, delete\_overlay)

**GALLERY.SCATTER**?(type\_num, delete\_overlay)

Type\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the number of the format you want to
apply to the xy (scatter) chart.

Delete\_overlay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying
whether to delete an overlay chart.

  - > If delete\_overlay is TRUE, Microsoft Excel deletes all overlays,
    > if present, and applies the new format to the main chart.

  - > If delete\_overlay is FALSE or omitted, Microsoft Excel applies
    > the new format to either the main chart or the overlay, depending
    > on the location of the selected series.
