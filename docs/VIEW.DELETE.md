# VIEW.DELETE

Equivalent to selecting a view and clicking the Delete button in the
Custom Views dialog box, which appears when you click the Custom Views
command on the View menu. In Microsoft Excel 97 or later, the Custom
Views command replaced the View Manager command that was available in
Microsoft Excel 95 and earlier versions. Removes a view from the active
workbook.

If this function is not available in Microsoft Excel 95 or in earlier
versions, you must install the View Manager add-in.

VIEW.DELETE returns the \#VALUE error value if view\_name is invalid or
if the workbook is protected.
