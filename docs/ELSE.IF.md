# ELSE.IF

Used with IF, ELSE, and END.IF to control which functions are carried
out in a macro. ELSE.IF signals the beginning of a group of formulas in
a macro sheet that will be carried out if the preceding IF or ELSE.IF
function returns FALSE and if logical\_test is TRUE. Use ELSE.IF with
IF, ELSE, and END.IF when you want to perform multiple actions based on
a condition. This method is preferable to using GOTO because it makes
your macros more structured.

**Syntax**

**ELSE.IF**(**logical\_test**)

Logical\_test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that ELSE.IF
uses to determine what functions to carry out next&mdash;that is, where
to branch.

  - > If logical\_test is TRUE, Microsoft Excel carries out the
    > functions between the ELSE.IF function and the next ELSE.IF, ELSE,
    > or END.IF function.

  - > If logical\_test is FALSE, Microsoft Excel immediately branches to
    > the next ELSE.IF, ELSE, or END.IF function.


**Remarks**

  - > ELSE.IF must be entered in a cell by itself.

  - > Logical\_test will always be evaluated, even if the ELSE.IF
    > section is not reached (due to a previous IF or ELSE.IF
    > logical\_test evaluating to TRUE). For this reason, you should not
    > use formulas that carry out actions for logical\_test. If you need
    > to base the ELSE.IF condition on the return value of a formula
    > that carries out an action, use the form "ELSE, IF(logical\_test),
    > and END.IF" in place of "ELSE.IF(logical\_test)."
