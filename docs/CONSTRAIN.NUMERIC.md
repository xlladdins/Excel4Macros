# CONSTRAIN.NUMERIC

Equivalent to pressing the Constrain Numeric button. The Constrain
Numeric button can be found in the Insert category on the Commands tab
(Customize dialog box). The Customize dialog box appears when you choose
the Toolbars command from the View menu and then choose the Customize
command. Constrains handwriting recognition to numbers and punctuation
only. Use this function in a macro to improve the accuracy of
handwriting recognition when the user is entering a series of numbers or
formulas.

**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This function is only available if you are
using Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing.

**Syntax**

**CONSTRAIN.NUMERIC**(numeric\_only)

Numeric\_only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that turns the
numeric constraint on or off. If numeric\_only is TRUE, only numbers and
digits are recognized; if FALSE, all characters are recognized as usual.
if numeric\_only is omitted, the numeric constraint is toggled.

**Remarks**

When the numeric constraint is on, Microsoft Excel recognizes only the
following symbols:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 $ \# @ % ( ) - + = { } : \< \> , ? | .

**Tip**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use GET.WORKSPACE(45) to make sure you're
running Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing.
