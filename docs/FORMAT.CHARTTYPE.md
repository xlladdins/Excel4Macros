# FORMAT.CHARTTYPE

Changes the chart type for a selected data series, a group of data
series, or an entire chart.

**Syntax**

**FORMAT.CHARTTYPE**(**apply\_to**, group\_num, dimension,
**type\_num**)

**FORMAT.CHARTTYPE**?(apply\_to, group\_num, dimension, type\_num)

Apply\_to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 1 to 3 specifying what
part of a chart the new chart type effects.

|           |                      |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| **Value** | **Part of chart**    |
| 1         | Selected data series |
| 2         | Group of data series |
| 3         | Entire chart         |

Group\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the number of the group
you want to change as listed in the Group list box of the Chart Type
dialog box, which appears when you click Chart Type from the Format menu
while a chart is active. Groups are numbered starting with 1 for the
group at the top of the list. This argument is required if apply\_to
equals 2; otherwise it is ignored.

Dimension&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies whether to apply a 2-D or 3-D
chart type. Use 1 for a 2-D chart type or 2 for a 3-D chart type. If
omitted, uses the same dimension as the series, group, or chart to be
changed.

Type\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the chart type to apply.
Meaning of type\_num varies depending on the value of dimension:

|               |                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Type\_num** | **Chart type if dimension is 1** |
| 1             | Area or 3-D area                 |
| 2             | Bar or 3-D bar                   |
| 3             | Column or 3-D column             |
| 4             | Line or 3-D line                 |
| 5             | Pie or 3-D pie                   |
| 6             | Doughnut or 3-D surface          |
| 7             | Radar                            |
| 8             | XY (scatter)                     |
