# CHART.TREND

A trendline can be added to only to the these chart types: bar, column,
stacked column, scatter, line, and area.

**Syntax**

**CHART.TREND**(**type**, ord\_per, forecast, backcast, intercept,
equation, r\_squared, name)

Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the type of trend or regression.

|            |                |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| **Number** | **Type used**  |
| 1          | Linear         |
| 2          | Logarithmic    |
| 3          | Polynomial     |
| 4          | Power          |
| 5          | Exponential    |
| 6          | Moving Average |

Ord\_per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depends on type. If type is 3, then
ord\_per is the order of the polynomial. If type is 6, ord\_per is the
number of periods for the moving average. If type is neither 3 nor 6,
then ord\_per is ignored.

Forecast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the number of periods or units to
extrapolate the trendline in the positive or forward direction. This
argument is ignored for moving averages (type 6). The default is zero.

Backcast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying the number of
periods or units to extrapolate the trendline in the negative or
backward direction. This argument is ignored for moving averages (type
6). The default is zero.

Intercept&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying the value of the
y-intercept of the trendline, if it is already known. If FALSE or
omitted, Microsoft Excel will calculate the y-intercept . This argument
is ignored for moving averages.

Equation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying whether
the trend equation should be displayed on the chart. If TRUE, the
equation will be displayed on the chart. If FALSE or omitted, the
equation will not be displayed on the chart.

R\_squared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying whether
the r-squared equation should be displayed on the chart. If TRUE, the
value will be displayed on the chart. If FALSE or omitted, the equation
will not be displayed on the chart.

Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a text string specifying the custom name
of the trendline. Can also be a logical value. If TRUE or omitted, the
automatic name will be used instead.

**Remarks**

  - > A trendline can not be added to a 3-D chart, a stacked chart, or
    > an 100% chart.

  - > The linear model calculates the least squares fit for a line
    > represented by the equation y&nbsp;=&nbsp;mx&nbsp;+&nbsp;b, where
    > m is the slope and b is the intercept.

  - > The logarithmic model calculates the least squares fit through
    > points using the equation y&nbsp;=&nbsp;c\*ln(x)&nbsp;+&nbsp;b,
    > where c and b are constants.

  - > The exponential model calculates the least squares fit through
    > points using the following equation:

> where c and b are constants.

  - > The polynomial model calculates the least squares fit through
    > points using the following equation:

> ![](./media/image10.png)
> 
> where b, c1, c2, c3, etc. are constants.

  - > The power model calculates the least squares fit through points
    > using the following equation:

> 
> where b and c are constants.
