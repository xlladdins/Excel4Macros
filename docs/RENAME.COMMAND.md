# RENAME.COMMAND

Changes the name of a built-in or custom menu command or the name of a
menu. Use RENAME.COMMAND to change the name of a command on a menu, for
example, when you create two custom commands that toggle on the menu.
Examples of two built-in commands that toggle are the Page Break and
Remove Page Break commands on the Insert menu.

**Syntax**

**RENAME.COMMAND**(**bar\_num, menu, command, name\_text**, position)

Bar\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be either the number of one of the
Microsoft Excel built-in menu bars or the number returned by a
previously run ADD.BAR function. See ADD.COMMAND for a list of ID
numbers for built-in menu bars.

Menu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be either the name of a menu as text or
the number of a menu. Menus are numbered starting with 1 from the left
of the screen.

Command&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be either the name of the command as
text or the number of the command to be renamed (the first command on a
menu is command 1). If command is 0, RENAME.COMMAND renames the menu
instead of the command. Because other macros can change the position of
custom menu commands, you should use the name of the command rather than
a number whenever possible.

If the specified menu bar, menu, or command does not exist,
RENAME.COMMAND returns the \#VALUE\! error value and interrupts the
macro.

Name\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the new name for the command.

Position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the command on a submenu
that you want to rename. If you use position, you must use command as
the name of the submenu.

**Tip**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To specify an access key for the new name,
precede the character you want to use with an ampersand (&). The access
key is indicated by an underline under one letter of a menu or command
name. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, you can use the General tab
in the Options dialog box to turn command underlining on or off. To see
the Options dialog box, click Options on the Tools menu.

**Example**

To rename the Save All command as Global Save, and to make the letter
"G" in Global Save an access key, use the following macro formula:

RENAME.COMMAND(10, "File", "Save All", "\&Global Save")
