<h1 id="embed">EMBED macro</h1>
<p>Displayed in the formula bar when an embedded object is selected. EMBED cannot be entered on a sheet or used in a macro.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>EMBED</strong>(<strong>object_class</strong>, item)</p>
<p>Object_class    is the name of the application and document type that created the embedded object. For example, the object_class arguments used when Microsoft Excel sheets are embedded in other applications are "Excel.sheet.5" and "Excel.Chart.5".</p>
<p>Item    is the area selected to copy, and determines the view on the embedded document. When item is empty text (""), EMBED creates a view on the entire document.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<p>If you delete the EMBED formula, the embedded object remains on the sheet as a graphic, and the link to the creating application is deleted. Double-clicking the object no longer starts the creating application.</p>
