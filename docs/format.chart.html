<h1 id="format.chart">FORMAT.CHART macro</h1>
<p>Equivalent to choosing the Options button in the Chart Type dialog box, which is available when you choose the Chart Type command from the Format menu when a chart is active. Formats the chart according to the arguments you specify.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>FORMAT.CHART</strong>(layer_num, view, overlap, angle, gap_width, gap_depth, chart_depth, doughnut_size, axis_num, drop, hilo, up_down, series_line, labels, vary)</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT.CHART</strong>?(layer_num, view, overlap, angle, gap_width, gap_depth, chart_depth, doughnut_size, axis_num, drop, hilo, up_down, series_line, labels, vary)</p>
<p>Several of the following arguments are logical values corresponding to check boxes in the Options tab of Format (chart type) Group dialog box. If an argument is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects the corresponding check box; if FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears the check box. If an argument is omitted, the setting is unchanged.</p>
<p>Layer_num    is a number specifying which chart you want to change.</p>
<p>View    is a number specifying one of the subtypes in the Subtype tab of the Format (type) Group dialog box. The subtype varies depending on the type of chart.</p>
<p>Overlap    is a number from -100 to 100 specifying how you want bars or columns to be positioned. It corresponds to the Overlap edit box in the Options tab on the Format Bar Group Dialog box, which appears when you choose the Bar Group from the Format menu. Overlap is ignored if type_num is not 2 or 3 (bar or column chart).</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If overlap is positive, it specifies the percentage of overlap you want for bars or columns. For example, 50 would cause one-half of a bar or column to be covered by an adjacent bar or column. A value of zero prevents bars or columns from overlapping.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If overlap is negative, then bars or columns are separated by the specified percentage of the maximum available distance between any two bars or columns.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If overlap is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (bars or columns do not overlap), or it is unchanged if a value was previously set.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Angle    is a number from 0 to 360 specifying the angle of the first pie or doughnut slice (in degrees) if the chart is a pie or doughnut chart. If angle is omitted, it is assumed to be 0, or it is unchanged if a value was previously set.</p>
<p>Gap_width    is a number from 0 to 500 specifying the space between bar or column clusters as a percentage of the width of a bar or column. It corresponds to the Gap Width edit box in the Options tab on the Format Bar Group Dialog box, which appears when you choose the Bar Group from the Format menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Gap_width is ignored if type_num is not 2, 3, 8, or 12 (bar or column chart).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If Gap_width is omitted, it is assumed to be 50, or it is unchanged if a value was previously set.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next two arguments are for 3-D charts only, and correspond to check boxes in the Options tab of Format (chart type) Group dialog box.</p>
<p>Gap_depth    is a number from 0 to 500 specifying the depth of the gap in front of and behind a bar, column, area, or line as a percentage of the depth of the bar, column, area, or line.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Gap_depth is ignored if the chart is a pie chart or if it is not a 3-D chart.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If gap_depth is omitted and the chart is a 3-D chart, gap_depth is assumed to be 50, or it is unchanged if a value was previously set. If gap_depth is omitted and the view is side-by-side, stacked, or stacked 100%, gap_depth is assumed to be 0, or it is unchanged if a value was previously set.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chart_depth    is a number from 20 to 2000 specifying the visual depth of the chart as a percentage of the width of the chart.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Chart_depth is ignored if the chart is not a 3-D chart.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If Chart_depth is omitted, it is assumed to be 100, or it is unchanged if a value was previously set.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doughnut_size    specifies the size of the hole in a doughnut chart. Can be a value from 10% - 90%. Default is 50%.</p>
<p>Axis_num    is a number specifying whether to plot the chart on the primary axis or the secondary axis.</p>
<p>Drop    corresponds to the Drop Lines check box. Drop is available only for area and line charts.</p>
<p>Hilo    corresponds to the Hi-Lo Lines check box. Hilo is available only for 2-D line charts.</p>
<p>The next four arguments are logical values corresponding to check boxes in the Options tab of the Format (chart type) Group dialog box. If an argument is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects the corresponding check box; if FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears the check box. If an argument is omitted, the setting is unchanged.</p>
<p>Up_down    corresponds to the Up/Down Bars check box. Up_down is available only for 2-D line charts.</p>
<p>Series_line    corresponds to the Series Lines check box. Series_line is available only for 2-D stacked bar and column charts.</p>
<p>Labels    corresponds to the Radar Axis Labels check box. Labels is available only for radar charts.</p>
<p>Vary    corresponds to the Vary Colors By Point check box. Vary applies only to charts with one data series and is not available for area charts.</p>
