<h1 id="execute">EXECUTE macro</h1>
<p>Carries out commands in another program with which you have a dynamic data exchange (DDE) link. Use with EXEC, INITIATE, and SEND.KEYS to run another program through Microsoft Excel. (SEND.KEYS is available only in Microsoft Excel for Windows.)</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>   Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh requires system software version 7.0 or later for this function.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXECUTE</strong>(<strong>channel_num, execute_text</strong>)</p>
<p>Channel_num    is a number returned by a previously run INITIATE function. Channel_num refers to a channel through which Microsoft Excel communicates with another program.</p>
<p>Execute_text    is a text string representing commands you want to carry out in the program specified by channel_num. The form of execute_text depends on the program you are referring to. To include specific key sequences in execute_text, use the format described under key_text in the ON.KEY function.</p>
<p>If EXECUTE is not successful, it returns one of the following error values:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Value returned</strong></td>
<td><strong>Situation</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>#VALUE!</td>
<td>Channel_num is not a valid channel number.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>#N/A</td>
<td>The program you are accessing is busy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>#DIV/0!</td>
<td>The program you are accessing does not respond after a certain length of time or you have pressed ESC to cancel.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>#REF!</td>
<td>The keys specified in execute_text are refused by the application which you want to access.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<p>Commands sent to another program with EXECUTE will not work when a dialog box is displayed in the program. In Microsoft Excel for Windows, you can use SEND.KEYS to send commands that make selections in a dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>The following macro formula sends the number 25 and a carriage return to the application identified by channel_num 14:</p>
<p>EXECUTE(14, "25~")</p>
