# SET.PAGE.BREAK

Equivalent to clicking the Page Break command on the Insert menu. Sets
manual page breaks. Use SET.PAGE.BREAK to override the automatic page
breaks. Setting a manual page break changes the automatic page breaks
that follow it.

The page break occurs above and to the left of the active cell and
appears as dotted lines if you have set up a printer. If the active cell
is in column A, a manual page break is added only above the cell. If the
active cell is in row 1, a manual page break is added only at the left
edge of the cell. If the row or column next to the active cell already
has a page break, SET.PAGE.BREAK takes no action.
