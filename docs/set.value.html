<h1 id="set.value">SET.VALUE macro</h1>
<p>Changes the value of a cell or cells on the macro sheet (not the worksheet) without changing any formulas entered in those cells. Use SET.VALUE to assign initial values and to store values during the calculation of a macro. SET.VALUE is especially useful for initializing a dialog box and the conditional test in a WHILE loop. SET.VALUE assigns values to a specific reference or to the name of a reference that has already been defined. For information about creating a new name or entering data on a worksheet, see "Remarks" later in this topic.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>SET.VALUE</strong>(<strong>reference</strong>, values)</p>
<p>Reference    specifies the cell or cells on the macro sheet to which you want to assign a new value or values. If the cell is empty, enters the value in the cell.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If a cell in reference previously contained a formula, the formula is not changed, but the value of the cell might change. See the second example following.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If reference is a reference to a range of cells, rather than to a single cell, then values should be an array of the same size. If not, Microsoft Excel expands it into multiple values using the normal rules for expanding arrays. See the third example following.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Values    is the value or set of values to which you want to assign the cell or cells in reference.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following guidelines as you choose a function to set values on a worksheet or macro sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Use SET.VALUE to assign initial values to a reference (including names that have already been defined) on a macro sheet, and to store values during the calculation of a macro.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Use FORMULA to enter values in a worksheet cell.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Use SET.NAME to change the value of a name on a macro sheet (the name is created if it does not already exist). For more information, see SET.NAME.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Use DEFINE.NAME to create or change the value of a name on a worksheet.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>The following macro formula changes the value of cell A1 on the macro sheet to 1:</p>
<p>SET.VALUE($A$1, 1)</p>
<p>Suppose the name TempAverage refers to a cell containing the formula AVERAGE(Temp1, Temp2, Temp3). The following formula assigns the value 99 to this cell, even if the average of the arguments is not 99, without changing the formula in TempAverage:</p>
<p>SET.VALUE(TempAverage, 99)</p>
<p>The preceding formula is useful if a WHILE loop or some other conditional test depends on TempAverage and you want to force the conditional test to have a particular result. Of course, TempAverage is restored to its correct value as soon as it is recalculated. (Recall that unlike formulas in a worksheet, formulas in a macro sheet are not recalculated until the macro actually uses them.)</p>
<p>The following macro formula stores the values 1, 2, 3, and 4 in cells A1:B2:</p>
<p>SET.VALUE($A$1:$B$2, {1, 2;3, 4})</p>
