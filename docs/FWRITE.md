# FWRITE

Writes text to a file, starting at the current position in that file.
(For more information about a file's position, see FPOS.) If FWRITE
can't write to the file, it returns the \#N/A error value.

**Syntax**

**FWRITE**(**file\_num, text**)

File\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the unique ID number of the file you
want to write data to. File\_num is returned by a previously executed
FOPEN function. If file\_num is not valid, FWRITE returns the \#VALUE\!
error value.

Text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the text you want to write to the file.

**Example**

The following function writes the current month to the open file
identified as FileNumber:

FWRITE(FileNumber, TEXT(MONTH(NOW()),"mmmm"))
