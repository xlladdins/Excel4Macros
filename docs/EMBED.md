# EMBED

Displayed in the formula bar when an embedded object is selected. EMBED
cannot be entered on a sheet or used in a macro.

**Syntax**

**EMBED**(**object\_class**, item)

Object\_class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the application and
document type that created the embedded object. For example, the
object\_class arguments used when Microsoft Excel sheets are embedded in
other applications are "Excel.sheet.5" and "Excel.Chart.5".

Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the area selected to copy, and determines
the view on the embedded document. When item is empty text (""), EMBED
creates a view on the entire document.

**Remarks**

If you delete the EMBED formula, the embedded object remains on the
sheet as a graphic, and the link to the creating application is deleted.
Double-clicking the object no longer starts the creating application.
