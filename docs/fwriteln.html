<h1 id="fwriteln">FWRITELN macro</h1>
<p>Writes text, followed by a carriage return and linefeed, to a file, starting at the current position in that file. (For more information about a file's position, see FPOS.) If FWRITELN can't write to the file, it returns the #N/A error value. Use FWRITELN instead of FWRITE when you want to append a carriage return and linefeed to each group of characters that you write to a text file.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>FWRITELN</strong>(<strong>file_num, text</strong>)</p>
<p>File_num    is the unique ID number of the file you want to write data to. File_num is returned by a previously executed FOPEN function. If file_num is not valid, FWRITELN returns the #VALUE! error value.</p>
<p>Text    is the text you want to write to the file.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<p>In Microsoft Excel for Windows, FWRITELN writes text followed by a carriage return and a line feed. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, FWRITELN writes text followed by a carriage return only.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The following function writes the current month to the open file identified as FileNumber and starts a new line in the file:</p>
<p>FWRITELN(FileNumber, TEXT(MONTH(NOW()),"mmmm"))</p>
