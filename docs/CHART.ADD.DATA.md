**Syntax**

**CHART.ADD.DATA**(**ref**, rowcol, titles, categories, replace, series)

Ref&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the cell reference for the data that is
being dragged onto the chart

Rowcol&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the number 1 or 2 and specifies whether
the values corresponding to a particular data series are in rows or
columns. Enter 1 for rows or 2 for columns.

Titles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value corresponding to the
Series Names In First Column check box (or First Row, depending on the
value of rowcol) in the Paste Special dialog box.

  - > If titles is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects the check box and uses
    > the contents of the cell in the first column of each row (or first
    > row of each column) as the name of the data series in that row (or
    > column).

  - > If titles is FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears the check box and uses
    > the contents of the cell in the first column of each row (or first
    > row of each column) as the first data point of the data series.

Categories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value corresponding to
the Categories (X Labels) In First Row (or First Column, depending on
the value of rowcol) check box in the Paste Special dialog box.

  - > If categories is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects the check box and
    > uses the contents of the first row (or column) of the selection as
    > the categories for the chart.

  - > If categories is FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears the check box and
    > uses the contents of the first row (or column) as the first data
    > series in the chart.


Replace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value corresponding to the
Replace Existing Categories check box in the Paste Special dialog box.

  - > If replace is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects the check box and
    > applies categories while replacing existing categories with
    > information from the copied cell range.

  - > If replace is FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears the check box and
    > applies new categories without replacing any old ones.

Series&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying how cells are added
to a chart.
