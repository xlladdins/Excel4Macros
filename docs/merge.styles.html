<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>

<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If any styles from the workbook being merged have the same name as styles in the active workbook, a dialog box appears asking if you want to replace the existing definitions of the styles with the "merged" definitions of the styles. If you click the Yes button, all the definitions are replaced; if you click the No button, all the original definitions in the active workbook are retained.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>When you move a sheet with styles to another workbook with styles, any styles with identical names but conflicting definitions have the sheet name added to the style name.</p>
