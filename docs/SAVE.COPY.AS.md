current workbook settings, such as passwords and file protection. Does
not affect the current workbook. Use this command if you need a
temporary copy of the current workbook; for example, to include in an
electronic mail message.

**Syntax**

Document\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name you want to give the
copy of the workbook.

**Example**

Suppose that you are creating a macro that makes changes to a file
called BUDGET95.XLS. Use the following function to save a copy of this
file called TEMP.XLS without affecting BUDGET95.XLS:

SAVE.COPY.AS("temp.xls")
