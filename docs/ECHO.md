# ECHO

Controls screen updating while a macro is running. If a large macro uses
many commands that update the screen, use ECHO to make the macro run
faster.

**Syntax**

**ECHO**(logical)

Logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying whether
screen updating is on or off.

  - > If logical is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects screen updating.

  - > If logical is FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears screen updating.

  - > If logical is omitted, Microsoft Excel changes the current screen
    > update condition.


**Remarks**

  - > Screen updating is always turned back on when a macro ends.

  - > You can use GET.WORKSPACE to determine whether screen updating is
    > on or off.

[GET.WORKSPACE](GET.WORKSPACE.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns information about the workspace
