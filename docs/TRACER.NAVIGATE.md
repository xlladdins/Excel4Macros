# TRACER.NAVIGATE

Equivalent to double-clicking on a displayed tracer arrow. Moves the
selection from one end of a tracer arrow to the other. If it is an error
tracer arrow, then the selection goes to the end of the branch.

**Syntax**

**TRACER.NAVIGATE**(direction, arrow\_num, ref\_num)

Direction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value which, if TRUE,
moves the selection to the arrow endpoint in the precedents direction.
If FALSE, moves the selection to the arrow endpoint in the dependents
direction.

Arrow\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying which reference
a tracer arrow will follow. For example, a 1 indicates that the arrow
will follow the first reference in the formula. 1 is the default.

Ref\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the arrow is an external reference
arrow with multiple links, this argument tells which of the links to
follow. Refer to the Links dialog, which is displayed with the Links
command from the Edit menu. If ref\_num is 1, the link in the first
reference in the Links dialog box will be followed. The default is 1.

**Remarks**

  - > Returns TRUE if successful. Returns FALSE if arrow\_num exceeds
    > the number of tracer arrows or if there are no tracer arrows.

  - > Returns FALSE if ref\_num exceeds the number of links.

  - > Returns the \#VALUE\! error value if not available; for example,
    > if the selection is something other than a worksheet, or the
    > active cell does not contain an arrow.
