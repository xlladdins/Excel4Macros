# SERIES

Charts Only

Represents a data series in the active chart. SERIES is used only in
charts; you cannot enter it on a sheet or macro sheet. You normally
create or change data series by using the Chart Wizard or EDIT.SERIES
macro function, which is equivalent to the Edit Series command on the
Chart menu in Microsoft Excel version 4.0. However, you can edit a data
series manually by selecting it, switching to the formula bar, and
typing the changes.

**Syntax**

**SERIES**(name\_ref, categories, **values, plot\_order**)

Name\_ref&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the data series. It can
be an external reference to a single cell or a name defined as a single
cell. Name\_ref can also be text enclosed in quotation marks (for
example, "Projected Sales").

Categories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an external reference to the name
of the workbook and to the cells that contain one of the following sets
of data:

  - > Category labels for all charts except xy (scatter) charts

  - > X-coordinate data for xy (scatter) charts


Values&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an external reference to the name of
the workbook and to the cells that contain values (or y-coordinate data
in scatter charts).

Plot\_order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an integer specifying whether the
series is plotted first, second, or third, and so on, in the chart. No
two series can have the same plot\_order.

**Remarks**

  - > Categories and values can be arrays or references to a multiple
    > selection, although they cannot be names that refer to a multiple
    > selection. If you specify a multiple selection for any of these
    > arguments, make sure you include the necessary sets of parentheses
    > so that Microsoft Excel does not treat the components of the
    > references as separate arguments.

  - > If either categories or values is a multiple selection, then all
    > areas in that selection must be either vertical (more rows than
    > columns) or horizontal (more columns than rows).
