# SET.PREFERRED

Changes the default format that Microsoft Excel uses when you create a
new chart or when you format a chart PREFERRED macro function. When you
use the SET.PREFERRED function, the format of the active chart becomes
the preferred format.

**Syntax**

**SET.PREFERRED**(format)

Format&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the format that you want as
the default format for charts. If omitted, the format of the currently
active chart is used. If format is "Built\_in", then Microsoft Excel
will use the standard, built-in chart as the default. If the chart was
created in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and if format is "PREFERRED",
then the preferred chart format used in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 will
be used. Format is case sensitive.
