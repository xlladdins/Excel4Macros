# WINDOW.RESTORE

Changes the active window from maximized or minimized size to its
previous size. In Microsoft Excel for Windows, using WINDOW.RESTORE is
equivalent to pressing CTRL+F5 or double-clicking the title bar (or
double-clicking the icon if it is minimized). In Microsoft Excel for the
Macintosh, using WINDOW.RESTORE is equivalent to double-clicking the
title bar or clicking the zoom box.

**Syntax**

Window\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies which window to switch to
and restore.

    > a cell containing text.

    > its previous size. This operation is equivalent to double-clicking
    > the icon.
