# SAMPLE

Samples data.

If this function is not available, you must install the Analysis ToolPak
add-in.

**Syntax**

**SAMPLE**(**inprng**, outrng, **method, rate**, labels)

**SAMPLE**?(inprng, outrng, method, rate, labels)

Inprng&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the input range.

Outrng&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the first cell (the upper-left cell) in
the output column or the name, as text, of a new sheet to contain the
output column. If FALSE, blank, or omitted, places the output table in a
new workbook.

Method&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a text character that indicates the
type of sampling.

  - > If method is "P", then periodic sampling is used. The input range
    > is sampled every nth cell, where n = rate.

  - > If method is "R", then random sampling is used. The output column
    > will contain rate samples.


Rate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the sampling rate, if method is "P"
(periodic sampling). Rate is the number of samples to take if method is
"R" (random sampling).

Labels&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value.

  - > If labels is TRUE, then the first row or column of inprng contains
    > labels.

  - > If labels is FALSE or omitted, all cells in inprng are considered
    > data. Microsoft Excel generates appropriate data labels for the
    > output table.
