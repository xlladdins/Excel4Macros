# VIEW.DEFINE

Equivalent to clicking the Add button in the Custom Views dialog box in
Microsoft Excel 97 or later, which appears when you click the Custom
Views command on the View menu. In Microsoft Excel 97, the Custom Views
command replaced the View Manager command that was available in
Microsoft Excel 95 and earlier versions. Creates or replaces a view.

If this function is not available in Microsoft Excel 95 or in earlier
versions, you must install the View Manager add-in.

**Syntax**

**VIEW.DEFINE**(**view\_name**, print\_settings\_log, row\_col\_log)

View\_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is text enclosed in quotation marks
and specifies the name of the view you want to define for the sheet. If
the workbook already contains a view with view\_name, the new view
replaces the existing one.

Print\_settings\_log&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that, if
TRUE or omitted, includes current print settings in the view or, if
FALSE, does not include current print settings in the view.

Row\_col\_log&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that, if TRUE or
omitted, includes current row and column settings in the view or, if
FALSE, does not include current row and column settings in the view.
