# CALLER

Returns information about the cell, range of cells, command on a menu,
tool on a toolbar, or object that called the macro that is currently
running. Use CALLER in a subroutine or custom function whose behavior
depends on the location, size, name, or other attribute of the caller.

**Syntax**

**CALLER**( )

**Remarks**

  - > If the custom function is entered in a single cell, CALLER returns
    > the reference of that cell.

  - > If the custom function was part of an array formula entered in a
    > range of cells, CALLER returns the reference of the range.

  - > If CALLER appears in a macro called by an Auto\_Open, Auto\_Close,
    > Auto\_Activate, or Auto\_Deactivate macro, it returns the name of
    > the calling sheet.

  - > If CALLER appears in a macro called by a command on a menu, it
    > returns a horizontal array of three elements including the
    > command's position number, the menu number, and the menu bar
    > number.

  - > If CALLER appears in a macro called by an assigned-to-object
    > macro, it returns the object identifier.

  - > If CALLER appears in a macro called by a tool on a toolbar, it
    > returns a horizontal array containing the position number and the
    > toolbar name.

  - > If CALLER appears in a macro called by an ON.DOUBLECLICK or
    > ON.ENTRY function, CALLER returns the name of the chart object
    > identifier or cell reference, if applicable, to which the
    > ON.DOUBLECLICK or ON.ENTRY macro applies.

  - > If CALLER appears in a macro that was run manually, or for any
    > reason not described above, it returns the \#REF\! error value.


**Examples**

If the custom function MACROS\!VALUEONE is entered in cell B3 on a sheet
named SALES, the nested CALLER function returns the following values.

|                       |             |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| **Nested function**   | **Returns** |
| COLUMN(CALLER())      | 2           |
| COLUMNS(CALLER())     | 1           |
| GET.CELL(1, CALLER()) | SALES\!$B$3 |
| ROW(CALLER())         | 3           |
| ROWS(CALLER())        | 1           |

If the same custom function was entered into an array in cells B2:C3,
the following values would be returned.

|                     |             |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Nested function** | **Returns** |
| COLUMN(CALLER())    | 2           |
| COLUMNS(CALLER())   | 2           |
| ROW(CALLER())       | 2           |
| ROWS(CALLER())      | 2           |
