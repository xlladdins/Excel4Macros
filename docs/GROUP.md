# GROUP

Creates a single object from several selected objects and returns the
object identifier of the group (for example, "Group 5"). Use GROUP to
combine a number of objects so that you can move or resize them
together.

If no object is selected, only one object is selected, or a group is
already selected, GROUP returns the \#VALUE\! error value and interrupts
the macro.
