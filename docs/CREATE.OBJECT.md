# CREATE.OBJECT

Draws an object on a sheet or macro sheet and returns a value
identifying the object created. It is generally easier to use the macro
recorder to enter this function on your macro sheet.

**Syntax 1**

Lines, rectangles, ovals, arcs, pictures, text boxes, and buttons

**CREATE.OBJECT**(**obj\_type**, **ref1**, x\_offset1, y\_offset1,
**ref2**, x\_offset2, y\_offset2, text, fill, editable)

**Syntax 2**

Polygons

**CREATE.OBJECT**(**obj\_type**, **ref1**, x\_offset1, y\_offset1,
**ref2**, x\_offset2,  
y\_offset2, **array**, fill)

**Syntax 3**

Embedded charts

**CREATE.OBJECT**(**obj\_type**, **ref1**, x\_offset1, y\_offset1,
**ref2**, x\_offset2,  
y\_offset2, xy\_series, fill, gallery\_num, type\_num, plot\_visible)

Obj\_type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying the type of
object to create.

Ref1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the cell from which the
upper-left corner of the object is drawn, or from which the upper-left
corner of the object's bounding rectangle is defined.

X\_offset1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the horizontal distance from the
upper-left corner of ref1 to the upper-left corner of the object or to
the upper-left corner of the object's bounding rectangle. X\_offset1 is
measured in points. A point is 1/72nd of an inch. If x\_offset1 is
omitted, it is assumed to be 0.

Y\_offset1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the vertical distance from the
upper-left corner of ref1 to the upper-left corner of the object or to
the upper-left corner of the object's bounding rectangle. Y\_offset1 is
measured in points. If y\_offset1 is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.

Ref2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the cell from which the
lower-right corner of the object is drawn, or from which the lower-right
corner of the object's bounding rectangle is defined.

X\_offset2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the horizontal distance from the
upper-left corner of ref2 to the lower-right corner of the object or to
the lower-right corner of the object's bounding rectangle. X\_offset2 is
measured in points. If x\_offset2 is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.

Y\_offset2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the vertical distance from the
upper-left corner of ref2 to the lower-right corner of the object or to
the lower-right corner of the object's bounding rectangle. Y\_offset2 is
measured in points. If y\_offset2 is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.

Text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the text that appears in a text
box or button. If text is omitted for a button, the button is named
"Button n", where n is a number. If obj\_type is not 6 or 7, text is
ignored.

Fill&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying whether the
object is filled or transparent. If fill is TRUE, the object is filled;
if FALSE, the object is transparent; if omitted, the object is filled
with an applicable pattern for the object being created.

Array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an n by 2 array of values, or a
reference to a range of cells containing values, that indicate the
position of each vertex in a polygon, relative to the upper-left corner
of the polygon's bounding rectangle.

  - > A vertex is a point that is defined by a pair of coordinates in
    > one row of array.

  - > If the polygon contains many vertices, one array may not be
    > sufficient to define it. If the number of characters in the
    > formula exceeds 1024, you must include one or more EXTEND.POLYGON
    > functions. If you're recording a macro, Microsoft Excel
    > automatically records EXTEND.POLYGON functions as needed. For more
    > information, see EXTEND.POLYGON.


Xy\_series&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 0 to 3 that specifies
how data is arranged in a chart and corresponds to options in the Paste
Special dialog box.

|                |                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Xy\_series** | **Result**                                                                         |
| 0              | Displays a dialog box if the selection is ambiguous                                |
| 1 or omitted   | First row/column is the first data series                                          |
| 2              | First row/column contains the category (x) axis labels                             |
| 3              | First row/column contains the x-values; the created chart is an xy (scatter) chart |

&nbsp;

  - > Xy\_series is ignored unless obj\_type is 5 (chart).

  - > If you want more control over how the data is arranged, use the
    > plot\_by, categories, and ser\_titles arguments to the
    > CHART.WIZARD function. For more information, see CHART.WIZARD.


Gallery\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 1 to 15 specifying
the type of embedded chart you want to create.

|                  |              |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| **Gallery\_num** | **Chart**    |
| 1                | Area         |
| 2                | Bar          |
| 3                | Column       |
| 4                | Line         |
| 5                | Pie          |
| 6                | Radar        |
| 7                | XY (scatter) |
| 8                | Combination  |
| 9                | 3-D area     |
| 10               | 3-D bar      |
| 11               | 3-D column   |
| 12               | 3-D line     |
| 13               | 3-D pie      |
| 14               | 3-D surface  |
| 15               | Doughnut     |

Type\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number identifying a formatting
option for a chart. The formatting options are shown in the dialog box
of the AutoFormat command that corresponds to the type of chart you're
creating. The first formatting option in any gallery is 1.

Plot\_visible&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that corresponds
to the Plot Visible Cells Only checkbox in the Chart tab of the Options
dialog box. If FALSE or omitted, all values are plotted.

Editable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that determines
whether the drop down list box is editable or not. If TRUE, the drop
down list box is editable. If FALSE, the drop down list box is not
editable. If obj\_type is not 20, this argument is ignored.

**Remarks**

  - > CREATE.OBJECT returns the object identifier of the object it
    > created. Object identifiers include text describing the object,
    > such as "Text" or "Oval", and a number indicating the order in
    > which the object was created. For example, CREATE.OBJECT returns
    > "Oval 3" after creating an oval that is the third object in the
    > workbook.

  - > If the offsets are not specified, the object is drawn from the
    > upper-left corner of ref1 to the upper-left corner of ref2.

  - > If the object is not a picture and either ref1 or ref2 is omitted,
    > CREATE.OBJECT returns the \#VALUE\! error value and does not
    > create the object.

  - > CREATE.OBJECT also selects the object.

  - > You must use the COPY function before the CREATE.OBJECT function
    > to create a chart or a picture.


**Tip**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assign a macro to an object, use the
ASSIGN.TO.OBJECT function immediately after creating the object.
