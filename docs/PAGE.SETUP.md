# PAGE.SETUP

Equivalent to clicking the Page Setup command on the File menu. Use
PAGE.SETUP to control the printed appearance of your sheets.

There are three syntax forms of PAGE.SETUP. Syntax 1 applies if a sheet
or macro sheet is active; syntax 2 applies if a chart is active; syntax
three applies to Visual Basic modules and the info Window.

Arguments correspond to check boxes and text boxes in the Page Setup
dialog box. Arguments that correspond to check boxes are logical values.
If an argument is TRUE, Microsoft Excel selects the check box; if FALSE,
Microsoft Excel clears the check box. Arguments for margins are always
in inches, regardless of your country setting.

Scale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number representing the percentage to
increase or decrease the size of the sheet. All scaling retains the
aspect ratio of the original.

  - > To specify a percentage of reduction or enlargement, set scale to
    > the percentage.

  - > For worksheets and macros, you can specify the number of pages
    > that the printout should be scaled to fit. Set scale to a two-item
    > horizontal array, with the first item equal to the width and the
    > second item equal to the height. If no constraint is necessary in
    > one direction, you can set the corresponding value to \#N/A.

  - > Scale can also be a logical value. To fit the print area on a
    > single page, set scale to TRUE.


Pg\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the number of the first page.
If zero, sets first page to zero. If "Auto" is used, then the page
numbering is set to automatic. If omitted, PAGE.SETUP retains the
existing pg\_num.

Pg\_order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies whether pagination is
left-to-right and then down, or top-to-bottom and then right.

|               |                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Pg\_order** | **Pagination**            |
| 1             | Top-to-bottom, then right |
| 2             | Left-to-right, then down  |

Bw\_cells&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that specifies
whether to print cells and all graphic objects, such as text boxes and
buttons, in color.

  - > If bw\_cells is TRUE, Microsoft Excel prints cell text and borders
    > in black and cell backgrounds in white.

  - > If bw\_cells is FALSE , Microsoft Excel prints cell text, borders,
    > and background patterns in color (or in gray scale).


Bw\_chart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that specifies
whether to print chart in color.

Size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number corresponding to the options in
the Chart Size box, and determines how you want the chart printed on the
page within the margins. Size is available only in the chart form of the
function.

|          |                             |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| **Size** | **Size to print the chart** |
| 1        | Screen size                 |
| 2        | Fit to page                 |
| 3        | Full page                   |

Quality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the print quality in
dots-per-inch. To specify both horizontal and vertical print quality,
use an array of two values.

Head\_margin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the placement, in inches, of the
running head margin from the edge of the page.

Foot\_margin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the placement, in inches, of the
running foot margin from the edge of the page.

Draft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the Draft Quality checkbox
in the Sheet tab and in the Chart tab of the Page Setup dialog box. If
FALSE or omitted, graphics are printed with the sheet. If TRUE, no
graphics are printed.

Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies whether to print cell notes with
the sheet. If TRUE, both the sheet and the cell notes are printed. If
FALSE or omitted, just the sheet is printed.

**Remarks**

Microsoft Excel no longer requires you to enter formatting codes to
format headers and footers, but the codes are still supported and
recorded by the macro recorder. You can include these codes as part of
the head and foot text strings to align portions of the header or footer
to the left, right, or center; to include the page number, date, time,
or workbook name; and to print the header or footer in bold or italic.
