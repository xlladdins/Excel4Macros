# FREEZE.PANES

Equivalent to clicking the Freeze Panes or Unfreeze Panes command on the
Window menu. Splits the active window into panes, creates frozen panes,
or freezes or unfreezes existing panes. Use FREEZE.PANES to keep row or
column titles on the screen while scrolling to other parts of the sheet.

**Syntax**

**FREEZE.PANES**(logical, col\_split, row\_split)

Logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying which
command FREEZE.PANES is equivalent to.

  - > If logical is TRUE, the function is equivalent to the Freeze Panes
    > command. It freezes panes if they exist, or creates them, splits
    > them at the specified position, and freezes them if they do not
    > exist. If the panes are already frozen, FREEZE.PANES takes no
    > action.

  - > If logical is FALSE, the function is equivalent to the Unfreeze
    > Panes command. If no panes exist, FREEZE.PANES takes no action.

  - > If logical is omitted, FREEZE.PANES creates and then freezes panes
    > if no panes exist, freezes existing panes if they're not currently
    > frozen, or unfreezes existing panes if they're currently frozen.


Col\_split&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies where to split the window
vertically and is measured in columns from the left of the window.

Row\_split&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies where to split the window
horizontally and is measured in rows from the top of the window.

Col\_split and row\_split are ignored unless logical is TRUE and split
panes do not exist.

**Remarks**

To create panes without freezing or unfreezing them, use the SPLIT
function. You can freeze the panes later using the FREEZE.PANES
function.
