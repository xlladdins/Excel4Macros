# ON.ENTRY

Runs a macro when you enter data into any cell on the specified sheet.

**Syntax**

**ON.ENTRY**(sheet\_text, macro\_text)

Sheet\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a text value specifying the name
of a sheet in a workbook. If sheet\_text is omitted, the macro is run
whenever you enter data into any sheet or macro sheet.

Macro\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of, or an R1C1-style
reference to, a macro you want to run when you enter data into the sheet
specified by sheet\_text. The name or reference must be in text form. If
macro\_text is omitted, entering data reverts to its normal behavior,
and any macros assigned by previous ON.ENTRY functions are turned off.

**Remarks**

  - > The macro is run only when you enter data in a cell, not when you
    > use edit commands or macro functions.

  - > To determine what cell had data entered into it, use a CALLER
    > function in the macro specified by macro\_text.
