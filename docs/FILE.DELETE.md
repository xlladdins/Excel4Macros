# FILE.DELETE

Deletes a file from the disk. Although you will normally delete files
manually, you can, for example, use FILE.DELETE in a macro to delete
temporary files created by the macro.

**Syntax**

**FILE.DELETE**(**file\_text**)

**FILE.DELETE**?(file\_text)

File\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the file to delete.

**Remarks**

  - > If Microsoft Excel can't find file\_text, it displays a message
    > saying that it cannot delete the file. To avoid this, include the
    > entire path in file\_text. See the following second and fifth
    > examples. You can also use FILES to generate an array of filenames
    > and then check if the file you want to delete is in the array.

  - > If a file is open when you delete it, the file is removed from the
    > disk but remains open in Microsoft Excel.

  - > In the dialog-box form, FILE.DELETE?, you can use an asterisk (\*)
    > to represent any series of characters and a question mark (?) to
    > represent any single character. See the following third and sixth
    > examples.


**Examples**
