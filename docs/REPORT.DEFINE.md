# REPORT.DEFINE

Equivalent to clicking the Report Manager command on the View menu and
then clicking the Add option in the Report Manager dialog box. Creates
or replaces a report definition. If this function is not available, you
must install the Report Manager add-in.

**Syntax**

**REPORT.DEFINE**(**report\_name, sections\_array**, pages\_logical)

Report\_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the name of the report. If
the workbook already contains a report with report\_name, the new report
replaces the existing one.

Sections\_array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an array that contains one or
more rows of view, scenario, and sheet name that define the report. The
sheet name is the sheet on which the view and scenario are defined. If
the sheet name is not specified, the current sheet is used when
REPORT.DEFINE is run.

Pages\_logical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that, if TRUE
or omitted, specifies continuous page numbers for multiple sections or,
if FALSE, resets page numbers to 1 for each new section.

**Remarks**

  - > REPORT.DEFINE returns the \#VALUE error value if report\_name is
    > invalid or if the workbook is protected.

  - > If there are no reports defined, this function will bring up the
    > Add Report dialog box.
