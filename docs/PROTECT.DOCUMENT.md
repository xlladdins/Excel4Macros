# PROTECT.DOCUMENT

Adds protection to or removes protection from the active sheet, macro
sheet, chart, dialog sheet, module, or scenario. Use PROTECT.DOCUMENT to
prevent yourself or others from changing cell contents, or objects in a
workbook. To protect workbooks in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or later,
see WORKBOOK.PROTECT.

**Syntax**

**PROTECT.DOCUMENT**(contents, windows, password, objects, scenarios)

**PROTECT.DOCUMENT**?( contents, windows, password, objects, scenarios)

Contents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value corresponding to the
Contents check box in the Protect Sheet dialog box.

  - > If contents is TRUE or omitted, Microsoft Excel selects the check
    > box and protects cells and chart elements on the sheet or macro
    > sheet.

  - > If contents is FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears the check box (and
    > removes protection if the correct password is supplied).


Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is provided for compatibility with
Microsoft Excel version 4.0. To protect the window placement and
structure of workbooks in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or later, see
WORKBOOK.PROTECT.

  - > If windows is TRUE, Microsoft Excel prevents a workbook's windows
    > from being moved or sized.

  - > If windows is FALSE or omitted, Microsoft Excel removes protection
    > if the correct password is supplied.


Password&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the password you specify in the form
of text to protect or unprotect the file. Password is case-sensitive.

  - > If password is omitted when you protect a sheet, then you will be
    > able to remove protection without a password. This is useful if
    > you want only to protect the sheet from accidental changes.

  - > If password is omitted when you try to remove protection from a
    > sheet that was protected with a password, the normal password
    > dialog box is displayed.

  - > Passwords are not recorded into the PROTECT.DOCUMENT function when
    > you use the macro recorder.


Objects&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value. This argument applies
only to charts, worksheets and macro sheets. Objects corresponds to the
Objects check box in the Protect Sheet dialog box.

  - > If objects is TRUE or omitted, Microsoft Excel selects the check
    > box and protects all locked objects on the chart, worksheet or
    > macro sheet.

  - > If objects is FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears the check box.

Scenarios&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value that corresponds to
the Scenarios check box on the Protect Sheet dialog box. If TRUE,
Microsoft Excel protects all the scenarios. If FALSE, the scenarios are
not protected.

**Remarks**

  - > If contents and objects are FALSE, PROTECT.DOCUMENT carries out
    > the Unprotect Sheet command. If contents, or objects is TRUE, it
    > carries out the Protect Sheet command.

  - > Make sure that you hide macro sheets that protect or unprotect
    > worksheets. If you type a password directly into the function on
    > an unhidden macro sheet, then someone could see the password
    > needed to unprotect the worksheet. For example,
    > PROTECT.DOCUMENT(TRUE, TRUE, "XD1411C", TRUE).


**Warning**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you forget the password of a workbook
that was previously protected with a password, you cannot unprotect the
workbook.
