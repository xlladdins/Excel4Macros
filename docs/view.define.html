<p>Equivalent to clicking the Add button in the Custom Views dialog box in Microsoft Excel 97 or later, which appears when you click the Custom Views command on the View menu. In Microsoft Excel 97, the Custom Views command replaced the View Manager command that was available in Microsoft Excel 95 and earlier versions. Creates or replaces a view.</p>
<p>If this function is not available in Microsoft Excel 95 or in earlier versions, you must install the View Manager add-in.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>VIEW.DEFINE</strong>(<strong>view_name</strong>, print_settings_log, row_col_log)</p>
<p>View_name    is text enclosed in quotation marks and specifies the name of the view you want to define for the sheet. If the workbook already contains a view with view_name, the new view replaces the existing one.</p>
<p>Print_settings_log    is a logical value that, if TRUE or omitted, includes current print settings in the view or, if FALSE, does not include current print settings in the view.</p>
<p>Row_col_log    is a logical value that, if TRUE or omitted, includes current row and column settings in the view or, if FALSE, does not include current row and column settings in the view.</p>
