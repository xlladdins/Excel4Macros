# DELETE.MENU

Deletes a menu or submenu. Use DELETE.MENU to delete menus you have
added to menu bars when the supporting macro sheet is closed (using an
Auto\_Close macro), or any time you want to remove a menu.

**Syntax**

**DELETE.MENU**(**bar\_num, menu**, submenu)

Bar\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the menu bar from which you want to
delete the menu. Bar\_num can be the number of a Microsoft Excel
built-in menu bar or the number returned by a previously run ADD.BAR
function. For a list of ID numbers for built-in menu bars, see
ADD.COMMAND.

Menu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the menu you want to delete. Menu can be
either the name of a menu as text or the number of a menu. Menus are
numbered starting with 1 from the left of the screen. If the specified
menu does not exist, DELETE.MENU returns the \#VALUE\! error value and
interrupts the macro. After a menu is deleted, the menu number for each
menu to the right of that menu is decreased by 1.

Submenu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the submenu you want to
delete or the number of the menu in the list of commands.

**Remarks**

You cannot delete a shortcut menu. Instead, use ENABLE.COMMAND to
prevent the user from accessing a shortcut menu.

**Example**

The following macro formula deletes the Reports menu from the custom
menu bar created by the ADD.BAR function in a cell named Financials:

DELETE.MENU(Financials, "Reports")
