# CUSTOM.REPEAT

Allows custom commands to be repeated using the Repeat tool or the
Repeat command on the Edit menu. Also allows custom commands to be
recorded using the macro recorder.

**Syntax**

**CUSTOM.REPEAT**(macro\_text, repeat\_text, record\_text)

Macro\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of, or a reference to,
the macro you want to run when the Repeat command is chosen. If
macro\_text is omitted, no repeat macro is run, but the custom command
can still be recorded.

Repeat\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the text you want to use as the
repeat command on the Edit menu (for example, "Repeat Reports"). You can
omit repeat\_text and macro\_text if you only want to record the formula
specified by record\_text when using the macro recorder.

Record\_text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the formula you want to record.
For example, if the user clicks a command named Run Reports in Macro 1,
the record\_text argument would be "=Macro1\!RunReports()", where
RunReports is the name of the macro called by the Run Reports command.

  - > References in record\_text must be in R1C1 format.

  - > If record\_text is omitted, the macro recorder records normally (a
    > RUN function with the first cell of the macro as its argument).

  - > If you are not recording a macro, record\_text is ignored.


**Tip**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place CUSTOM.REPEAT at the end of the macro you
will want to repeat. If you place it before the end, then the macro
formulas that follow CUSTOM.REPEAT may interfere with the desired
effects of CUSTOM.REPEAT. The Repeat tool and the Repeat command
continue to change as you click subsequent commands that can be
repeated.

**Example**

The following macro formula specifies that the macro RepeatReport on the
MenuMacros macro sheet in the current workbook will be run when the
Repeat Report command is chosen:

CUSTOM.REPEAT("MenuMacros\!RepeatReport", "Repeat Report")

**Related Function**

[CUSTOM.UNDO](CUSTOM.UNDO.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies a macro to run to undo a custom
command
