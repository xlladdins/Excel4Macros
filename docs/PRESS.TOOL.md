# PRESS.TOOL

Formats a button so that it appears either normal or depressed into the
screen.

**Syntax**

**PRESS.TOOL**(**bar\_id, position**, down)

Bar\_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the number or name of the
toolbar in which you want to change the button appearance. For detailed
information about bar\_id, see ADD.TOOL.

Position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the position of the button
within the toolbar. Position starts with 1 at the left side (if
horizontal) or at the top (if vertical).

Down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying the appearance
of the button. If down is TRUE, the button appears depressed into the
screen; if FALSE or omitted, it appears normal (up).

**Remarks**

This function applies only to custom buttons to which macros have
already been assigned. An error occurs if you try to process any other
type of button.

**Example**

The following macro formula sets the third button image on Toolbar4 to
normal (up).

PRESS.TOOL("Toolbar4", 3, FALSE)
