**Syntax**

**WORKBOOK.MOVE**(**name\_array**, dest\_book, position\_num)

**WORKBOOK.MOVE**?(name\_array, dest\_book, position\_num)

Name\_array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of a sheet or an array of
names of sheets in the active workbook that you want to move.

Dest\_book&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the workbook to which
you want to move name\_array. If dest\_book is omitted, WORKBOOK.MOVE
moves the sheet out of the workbook and puts it in a new separate
workbook. If dest\_book is the same as the current book, then the sheet
is moved within the workbook.

Position\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number that specifies the
target position for the sheet within dest\_book. The first position is
1.

  - > If position\_num is specified, Microsoft Excel inserts the sheet
    > at the specified position in the workbook.

  - > If position\_num is omitted, Microsoft Excel moves the sheet to
    > the last position in the workbook. If you move the last sheet out
    > of a workbook, the workbook closes.
