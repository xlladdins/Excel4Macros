# WORKBOOK.SELECT

Equivalent to selecting a sheet or group of sheets in the active
workbook. If you select a group of sheets, subsequent commands effect
all the sheets in the group.

**Syntax**

**WORKBOOK.SELECT**(name\_array, active\_name, replace)

Name\_array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a horizontal array of text names
of sheets you want to select. If name\_array is omitted, no sheets are
selected.

Active\_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of a single sheet in the
workbook that you want to be the active sheet. If active\_name is
omitted, the first sheet in name\_array is made the active sheet.

Replace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies whether the currently selected
sheets or macro sheets are to be replaced by name\_array. If TRUE or
omitted, then the current sheet selection is replaced by name\_array. If
FALSE, then name\_array will be appended to the current sheet.
