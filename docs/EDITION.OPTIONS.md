Sets options in, or performs actions on, the specified publisher or

the Macintosh.

**Syntax**

**EDITION.OPTIONS**(**edition\_type**, edition\_name, reference,
**option**, appearance, size, formats)

Edition\_type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the number 1 or 2 specifying the
type of edition.

|                   |                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Edition\_type** | **Type of edition** |
| 1                 | Publisher           |
| 2                 | Subscriber          |

Edition\_name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of the edition you want
to change the edition options for or to perform actions on. If
edition\_name is omitted, reference is required.

Reference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the range (given in text form
as a name or an R1C1-style reference) occupied by the publisher or
subscriber.

  - > Reference is required if you have more than one publisher or
    > subscriber of edition\_name on the active workbook. Use reference
    > to specify the location of the publisher or subscriber for which
    > you want to set options.

  - > If edition\_type is 1 and the publisher is an embedded chart, or
    > if edition\_type is 2 and the subscriber is a picture, reference
    > is the object identifier as displayed in the reference area.

  - > If reference is omitted, edition\_name is required.


Option&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 1 to 6 specifying the
edition option you want to set or the action you want to take, according
to the following two tables. Options 2 to 6 are only available if you
are using Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh with system software version
7.0 or later.

If a publisher is specified, then option applies as follows.

for appearance is 1 if the selection is a sheet or macro sheet and 2 if
