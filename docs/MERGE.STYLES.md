the styles from another workbook into the active workbook. Use

**Syntax**

**MERGE.STYLES**(document\_text)

Document\_text is the name of a sheet in a workbook from which you want
to merge styles into the active workbook.

**Remarks**

  - > If any styles from the workbook being merged have the same name as
    > styles in the active workbook, a dialog box appears asking if you
    > want to replace the existing definitions of the styles with the
    > "merged" definitions of the styles. If you click the Yes button,
    > all the definitions are replaced; if you click the No button, all
    > the original definitions in the active workbook are retained.

  - > When you move a sheet with styles to another workbook with styles,
    > any styles with identical names but conflicting definitions have
    > the sheet name added to the style name.
