# TEXT.TO.COLUMNS

Equivalent to clicking the Text To Columns command on the Data menu when
a column of data is to be separated into multiple columns. Parses text
into columns of data.

**Syntax**

**TEXT.TO.COLUMNS**(destination\_ref, data\_type, text\_delim,
consecutive\_delim, tab, semicolon, comma, space, other, other\_char,
field\_info)

The following arguments correspond to check boxes, option buttons and
text buttons in the Text To Columns Wizard, which is started with the
Text To Columns command on the Data menu.

Destination\_Ref&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a single cell reference to
specifies where to place the converted text.

Data\_Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying whether that
data is delimited (1) or fixed width (2)

Text\_Delim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;denotes how text strings are
represented, and can be one of the following values:

|            |                 |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| **Number** | **Text\_Delim** |
| 1          | "               |
| 2          | '               |
| 3          | none            |

Consecutive\_delim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value
corresponding to the Treat Consecutive Delimiters as One check box
which, if TRUE, allows consecutive delimiters (such as ",,,") to be
treated as a single delimiter. If FALSE, all consecutive delimiters are
considered separate column breaks.

Tab&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value which, if TRUE, specifies
that the column has tab delimiters. If FALSE, the column does not have
tab delimiters. Tab is ignored if data\_type is 2.

Semicolon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value which, if TRUE,
specifies that the column has semicolon delimiters. If FALSE, the column
does not have semicolon delimiters. Semicolon is ignored if data\_type
is 2.

Comma&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value which, if TRUE,
specifies that the column has comma delimiters. If FALSE, the column
does not have comma delimiters. Comma is ignored if data\_type is 2.

Space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value which, if TRUE,
specifies that the column has space delimiters. If FALSE, the column
does not have space delimiters. Space is ignored if data\_type is 2.

Other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value which, if TRUE,
specifies that the column has custom delimiters. If FALSE, the column
does not have custom delimiters. Other is ignored if data\_type is 2.

Other\_Char&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a single character that specifies
a delimiter not included in the list of delimiters. Other\_Char is
ignored if data\_type is 2 and if the argument other is FALSE.

Field\_Info&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an array which consists of the
following elements: "column number, data\_format", if data\_type is 1;
or "start\_pos, data\_format" if data\_type is 2. The second number
defines the column's data format, and can be one of the following.

|                           |                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **2<sup>nd</sup> Number** | **Data Format**             |
| 1                         | General                     |
| 2                         | Text                        |
| 3                         | Date, in the form MDY       |
| 4                         | Date, in the form DMY       |
| 5                         | Date, in the form YMD       |
| 6                         | Date, in the form MYD       |
| 7                         | Date, in the form DYM       |
| 8                         | Date, in the form YDM       |
| 9                         | Do not import column (skip) |
