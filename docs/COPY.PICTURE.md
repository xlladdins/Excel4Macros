# COPY.PICTURE

Equivalent to choosing the Copy Picture command from the Edit menu. The
Copy Picture command appears if you hold down SHIFT while choosing the
Edit menu. It copies a chart or range of cells to the Clipboard as a
graphic. Use COPY.PICTURE to create an image of the current selection or
chart for use in another program.

**Syntax**

**COPY.PICTURE**(appearance\_num, size\_num, type\_num)

**COPY.PICTURE**?(appearance\_num, size\_num, type\_num)

**Remarks**

Graphics are created differently on screen and on a printer. Thus, the
printed picture may look different from the one on screen.

copy the picture.
