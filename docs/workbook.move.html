<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>WORKBOOK.MOVE</strong>(<strong>name_array</strong>, dest_book, position_num)</p>
<p><strong>WORKBOOK.MOVE</strong>?(name_array, dest_book, position_num)</p>
<p>Name_array    is the name of a sheet or an array of names of sheets in the active workbook that you want to move.</p>
<p>Dest_book    is the name of the workbook to which you want to move name_array. If dest_book is omitted, WORKBOOK.MOVE moves the sheet out of the workbook and puts it in a new separate workbook. If dest_book is the same as the current book, then the sheet is moved within the workbook.</p>
<p>Position_num    is a number that specifies the target position for the sheet within dest_book. The first position is 1.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If position_num is specified, Microsoft Excel inserts the sheet at the specified position in the workbook.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If position_num is omitted, Microsoft Excel moves the sheet to the last position in the workbook. If you move the last sheet out of a workbook, the workbook closes.</p>
