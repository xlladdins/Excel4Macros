<h1 id="exec">EXEC macro</h1>
<p>Starts a separate program. Use EXEC to start other programs with which you want to communicate. Use EXEC with Microsoft Excel's other DDE functions (INITIATE, EXECUTE, and SEND.KEYS) to create a channel to another program and to send keystrokes and commands to the program. (SEND.KEYS is available only in Microsoft Excel for Windows.)</p>
<p>Syntax 1 is for Microsoft Excel for Windows. Syntax 2 is for Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax 1</strong></p>
<p>For Microsoft Excel for Windows</p>
<p><strong>EXEC</strong>(program_text, window_num)</p>
<p><strong>Syntax 2</strong></p>
<p>For Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh</p>
<p><strong>EXEC</strong>(program_text, , background, preferred_size_only)</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>   Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh requires system software version 7.0 or later for the last two arguments of this function.</p>
<p>Program_text    is the name, as a text string, of any executable file or, in Microsoft Excel for Windows, any data file that is associated with an executable file.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Use paths when the file or program to be started is not in the current directory or folder.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In Microsoft Excel for Windows, program_text can include any arguments and switches that are accepted by the program to be started. Also, if program_text is the name of a file associated with a specific installed program, EXEC starts the program and loads the specified file.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note   </strong>In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, you must use an extra comma after the program_text argument. This skips the window_num argument that does not apply to the Macintosh.</p>
<p>Window_num    is a number from 1 to 3 that specifies how the window containing the program should appear. Window_num is only available for use with Microsoft Excel for Windows. The window_num argument is allowed on the Macintosh, but it is ignored.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Window_num</strong></td>
<td><strong>Window appears</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1</td>
<td>Normal size</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2 or omitted</td>
<td>Minimized size</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>3</td>
<td>Maximized size</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Background    is a logical value that determines whether the program specified by program_text is opened as the active program or in the background, leaving Microsoft Excel as the active program. If background is TRUE, the program is started in the background; if FALSE or omitted, the program is started in the foreground. Background is only available for use with Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh and system software version 7.0 or later.</p>
<p>Preferred_size_only    is a logical value that determines the amount of memory allocated to the program. If preferred_size_only is TRUE, the program is opened with its preferred memory allocation; if FALSE or omitted, it opens with the available memory if greater than its minimum requirement. Preferred_size_only is only available for use with Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh and system software version 7.0 or later. For information about changing the preferred memory size, see your Macintosh documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong></p>
<p>In Microsoft Excel for Windows and in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh with system software version 7.0, if the EXEC function is successful, it returns the task ID number of the started program. The task ID number is a unique number that identifies a program. Use the task ID number in other macro functions, such as APP.ACTIVATE, to refer to the program. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh with system software version 6.0, if EXEC is successful, it returns TRUE. If EXEC is unsuccessful, it returns the #VALUE! error value.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>In Microsoft Excel for Windows, the following macro formula starts the program SEARCH.EXE. Use paths when the file or program to be started is not in the current directory:</p>
<p>EXEC("C:\WINDOWS\SEARCH.EXE")</p>
<p>The following macro formula starts Microsoft Word for Windows and loads the document SALES.DOC:</p>
<p>EXEC("C:\WINWORD\WINWORD.EXE C:\MYFILES\SALES.DOC")</p>
<p>In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, the following macro formula starts Microsoft Word:</p>
<p>EXEC("HARD DISK:APPS:WORD")</p>
