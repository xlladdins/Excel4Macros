# TRACER.DISPLAY

Equivalent to clicking the Trace Precedents or Trace Dependents buttons
on the Auditing toolbar on a worksheet. Allows tracer arrow to be
graphically displayed showing relationship among cells.

**Syntax**

**TRACER.DISPLAY**(direction, create)

Direction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is logical value which, if TRUE,
displays tracer arrows for precedents. If FALSE tracer arrows for
dependents are displayed.

Create&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value which, if TRUE displays
the next level of tracer arrows in the direction specified by direction.
If FALSE, removes the current level of tracer arrows in the direction
specified by direction. A level is the number of "arrows" away from the
source cell.

**Remark**

Returns the \#VALUE\! error value if not available; for example, the
selection is something other than a worksheet, or the cell(s) cannot be
traced.
