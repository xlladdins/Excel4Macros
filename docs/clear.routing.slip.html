<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLEAR.ROUTING.SLIP</strong>(reset_only_logical)</p>
<p>Reset_only_logical    is a logical value that specifies whether the routing slip should be cleared.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>This option is valid only after every recipient on the routing slip has received and forwarded the workbook. Setting reset_only_logical to TRUE in this case is equivalent to the Reset button in the routing slip dialog.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If some recipients have not received or routed the workbook, reset_only_logical is ignored.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If reset_only_logical is FALSE or omitted and the workbook has been routed to all recipients, then the routing slip is removed from the workbook. A new slip can be subsequently added using ROUTING.SLIP.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
