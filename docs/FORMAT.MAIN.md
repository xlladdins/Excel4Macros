# FORMAT.MAIN

Equivalent to clicking the Main Chart command on the Format menu in
Microsoft Excel version 4.0. Formats a chart according to the arguments
you specify. This function is included for compatibility with Microsoft
Excel version 4.0. In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or later, this is
equivalent to clicking the Chart Type command on the Format menu. You
can also use the FORMAT.CHART function.

**Syntax**

**FORMAT.MAIN**(**type\_num**, view, overlap, gap\_width, vary, drop,
hilo, angle, gap\_depth, chart\_depth, up\_down, series\_line, labels,
doughnut\_size)

**FORMAT.MAIN**?(type\_num, view, overlap, gap\_width, vary, drop, hilo,
angle, gap\_depth, chart\_depth, up\_down, series\_line, labels,
doughnut\_size)

Type\_num&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying the type of
chart.

|               |              |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| **Type\_num** | **Chart**    |
| 1             | Area         |
| 2             | Bar          |
| 3             | Column       |
| 4             | Line         |
| 5             | Pie          |
| 6             | XY (Scatter) |
| 7             | 3-D Area     |
| 8             | 3-D Column   |
| 9             | 3-D Line     |
| 10            | 3-D Pie      |
| 11            | Radar        |
| 12            | 3-D Bar      |
| 13            | 3-D Surface  |
| 14            | Doughnut     |

View&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number specifying one of the views in
the Data View box in the Main Chart dialog box. The view varies
depending on the type of chart.

Overlap&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from -100 to 100 specifying
how you want bars or columns to be positioned. It corresponds to the
Overlap box in the Main Chart dialog box. Overlap is ignored if
type\_num is not 2 or 3 (bar or column chart).

  - > If overlap is positive, it specifies the percentage of overlap you
    > want for bars or columns. For example, 50 would cause one-half of
    > a bar or column to be covered by an adjacent bar or column. A
    > value of zero prevents bars or columns from overlapping.

  - > If overlap is negative, then bars or columns are separated by the
    > specified percentage of the maximum available distance between any
    > two bars or columns.

  - > If overlap is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (bars or columns do
    > not overlap), or it is unchanged if a value was previously set.

Gap\_width&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 0 to 500 specifying
the space between bar or column clusters as a percentage of the width of
a bar or column. It corresponds to the Gap Width box in the Main Chart
dialog box.

  - > Gap\_width is ignored if type\_num is not 2, 3, 8, or 12 (bar or
    > column chart).

  - > If gap\_width is omitted, it is assumed to be 50, or it is
    > unchanged if a value was previously set.

Several of the following arguments are logical values corresponding to
check boxes in the Main Chart dialog box. If an argument is TRUE,
Microsoft Excel selects the corresponding check box; if FALSE, Microsoft
Excel clears the check box. If an argument is omitted, the setting is
unchanged.

Vary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the Vary By Categories check
box. Vary applies only to charts with one data series and is not
available for area charts.

Drop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the Drop Lines check box.
Drop is available only for area and line charts.

Hilo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the Hi-Lo Lines check box.
Hilo is available only for line charts.

Angle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 0 to 360 specifying the
angle of the first pie slice (in degrees) if the chart is a pie chart.
If angle is omitted, it is assumed to be 0, or it is unchanged if a
value was previously set.

The next two arguments are for 3-D charts only.

Gap\_depth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 0 to 500 specifying
the depth of the gap in front of and behind a bar, column, area, or line
as a percentage of the depth of the bar, column, area, or line.

  - > Gap\_depth is ignored if the chart is a pie chart or if it is not
    > a 3-D chart.

  - > If gap\_depth is omitted and the chart is a 3-D chart, gap\_depth
    > is assumed to be 50, or it is unchanged if a value was previously
    > set. If gap\_depth is omitted and the view is side-by-side,
    > stacked, or stacked 100%, gap\_depth is assumed to be 0, or it is
    > unchanged if a value was previously set.


Chart\_depth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a number from 20 to 2000
specifying the visual depth of the chart as a percentage of the width of
the chart. Chart\_depth corresponds to the Chart Depth box in the Main
Chart dialog box.

  - > Chart\_depth is ignored if the chart is not a 3-D chart.

  - > If chart\_depth is omitted, it is assumed to be 100, or it is
    > unchanged if a value was previously set.


The next three arguments are logical values corresponding to check boxes
in the Main Chart dialog box. If an argument is TRUE, Microsoft Excel
selects the corresponding check box; if FALSE, Microsoft Excel clears
the check box. If an argument is omitted, the setting is unchanged. The
final argument is for compatibility with Microsoft Excel version 4.0.

Up\_down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the Up/Down Bars check
box. Up\_down is available only for line charts.

Series\_line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the Series Lines
check box. Series\_line is available only for stacked bar and column
charts.

Labels&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to the Radar Axis Labels check
box. Labels is available only for radar charts.

Doughnut\_size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specifies the size of the hole in
a doughnut chart. Can be a value from 10% - 90%. Default is 50%
