<h1 id="goto">GOTO macro</h1>
<p>Directs a macro to continue running at the upper-left cell of reference. Use GOTO to direct macro execution to another cell or a named range.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOTO</strong>(<strong>reference</strong>)</p>
<p>Reference    is a cell reference or a name that is defined as a reference. Reference can be an external reference to another macro sheet. If that macro sheet is not open, GOTO displays a message.</p>
<p><strong>Tip   </strong>It's often preferable to use IF, ELSE, ELSE.IF, and END.IF instead of GOTO when you want to perform multiple actions based on a condition because the IF method makes your macros more structured.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>If A1 contains the #N/A error value, then when the following formula is calculated, the macro branches to C3:</p>
<p>IF(ISERROR($A$1), GOTO($C$3))</p>
<p>You can also use macro names with GOTO statements. The following macro formula branches macro execution to a macro named Compile:</p>
<p>GOTO(Compile)</p>
<p>Because Compile is a named range, it should not be enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
